### Abstract

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for making causal inferences,
but RCTs are often not feasible in addiction research for ethical and logistic reasons.
Observational data from real-world settings have been increasingly used to guide clinical
decisions and public health policies. This paper introduces the potential outcomes framework for causal inference and summarizes well-established causal analysis methods for observational data, including matching, inverse probability treatment weighting, the
instrumental variable method and interrupted time-series analysis with controls. It provides examples in addiction research and guidance and analysis codes for conducting these analyses with example data sets.

## Organization of the Repo

We'd recommend you to organize your repo as follows.

* Include figures (`.jpg`, `.png`, ...) in a subdirectory called `figures/`, see [this example](figures/logo.png)
* Include data files (`.csv`, `.rda`, ...) in a subdirectory called `data/`, see [this example](data/experiment_data_counterfactual.rda)
* Include your R code (`.R` files) in a subdirectory called `R`, see [this example](R/my_function.R)
* In case you use quarto for your data product, include your `.qmd` files here, see [this example](demo_repo.qmd)

These basic recommendations are intended to give you a bit structure. You can deviate from them as you like but please make sure others should be able to understand what you did.
